1. This a POC to send application logs generated by node server to elasticsearch and kibana via filebeat
2. The node-app and filebeat are running in one namespace and kibana and elasticsearch are running in another namespace in docker containers.

RUN the below command seperately in both elk and node-app folder
- docker-compose up -d

The node server will spin-up which currently has 2 apis exposed
/
/health-check

which generates logs that are saved in a file in logs folder and are send to elasticsearch and Kibana for visualisation
